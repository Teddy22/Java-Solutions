Solutions to Math and other problems using Java

UriString.java

program implements a function that replaces all spaces in a string with a '%20'
given the true length of the string, and also enough spaces provided at the end of the string
to fit in all white space replacements
Example: "Mr John Smith    " => The true length of this string is 13, but enough spaces have been accomodated to account
for the '%20' characters required.


UriStringUsingArrayList.java

program implements a function that replaces all spaces in a string with a '%20'
This is another approach to implementing the UriString.java class on this repository
An ArrayList is used here
Any spaces before and after the target word/s are ignored


BubbleSort.java

An implementation of the Bubble sort method for a list of comparable objects. A Random object is used to generate integers for the test list of integers. The number of items in the list as well as the max number to be generated for the test list can altered as desired in the field variables.
