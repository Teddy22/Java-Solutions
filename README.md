UriString.java
program implements a function that replaces all spaces in a string with a '%20'
given the true length of the string, and also enough spaces provided at the end of the string
to fit in all white space replacements
Example: "Mr John Smith    " => The true length of this string is 13, but enough spaces have been accomodated to account
for the '%20' characters required.
